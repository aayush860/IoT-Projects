This automated car parking system uses 2 ESP8266 module.
One is to drive car and other one is to update available parking slots.

These both are connected to a 000webhost server.
Continuously updating and fetching information.

Contact is made when car wants to be parked.
First server tells available slots and this is how directions is sent to cars IoT.
In this way it gets its direction.
Then after parking parking's server is updated that this slot is full.
After leaving slot gets empty and server is updated. Hence making space for other cars.
